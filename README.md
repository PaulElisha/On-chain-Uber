# On-chain-Uber
Ride-hailing companies are common. I built a smart contract that can facilitate transactions between ride-hailing companies, drivers, and their clients.

## Business Logic

In this contract, we have clients and drivers who are both participants in the ride-hailing economy.

Both of them can create profiles on the DApp.

The client can book a trip, pay once they reach their destination, and also drop a review.

The driver can also drop a review as well.


## What I Learned

As usual, here are some things I learned while building this contract:

### Logic is super important

I spent a huge chunk of time thinking through how the how process should work. I wrote the process in Google Docs.

Then I began thinking of how to implement it with Solidity. By the way, it is almost a year since I wrote Solidity as I have been playing too much with Node and Python, so I had to refresh a lot of concepts too.

### Initializing Structs, Using Mappings, & Debugging

Before, it was more like I crammed how to initialize, update, and delete objects in structs. But now, everything seems a bit natural.

I had to also refresh my knowledge of mapping.

Noticed I debug a bit more easily now. When the compiler throws an error, I can quickly spot what to fix. I think there are some things no one will teach in engineering, and you will only get better at it the more you build.

## Contribution

If you detect security issues or how to make the contract better, be generous to send a PR.
